# PyNLO_util
Utility functions for use with PyNLO. Inside the examples directory these functions are used to simulate the YAG experiment in [this](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-21-23-28095&id=274338) paper.

**NOTE**: PyNLO uses python 2.7 so you must have a 2.7 environment to run the example code. If you use VS Code, 2.7 is not supported, you will need to run the files from the terminal.
