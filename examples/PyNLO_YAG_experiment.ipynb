    "## PyNLO YAG Simulation Setup and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section I attempt to replicate the experiments in [this](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-21-23-28095&id=274338) paper using a PyNLO fiber simulation. The reason for using a fiber simulation instead of a crystal simulation is the fact that PyNLO's crystal sovler only supports 3 wave mixing processes and not 4 wave mixing processes. Since YAG is centro symmetric we only care about the chi 3 processes so we are forced to model the system as a fiber. Since PyNLO solves the 1D nonlinear schrodinger equation throughout the \"fiber\" we should at the very least get results that qualitatively agree with a more robust 3D crystal solver. I will walk the reader through how I setup this simulation and then show the results."

    "The script that actually runs the simulation can be found in \"./PyNLO_YAG_experiment.py\". In this section I discuss the results and compare the data from some Lightwave Explorer simulations which attempt to model the same experiment. Overall the PyNLO simulations seem to more closely match the experimental results seen in Hemmer et al. The Lightwave Explorer simulations are limited by a non optimal multiphoton ionization model as well as increased simulation complexity, which would typically be good, but the processes trying to be modeled are highly nonlinear and the simulations quickly become a numerical nightmare. Despite this the PyNLO simulation does have some shortcomings. Since we are *actually* modelling a *fiber* and not a *crystal* the beams longitudal profile is simplied to a cylinder and not a typical guassian. As a result the simulation fails to model any effects which would occur due to the divergence/convergence of the beams radius. The radial profile of the beam is still guassian. PyNLO also fails to model plasma generation and is limited to 1 dimension (1D nonlinear schrodinger equation).\n",
